  <p><strong>This is from the perspective of Bobert, an old Tempest. Some background:</strong> <strong>Silverstorm was an<br>
  old Twilight Orderhead, and Twilight had just proclaimed that "Love" was a new tenant of the<br>
  Dark religion...</strong></p>

  <p>-----</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Silverstorm, I accept your gift of shrines that were just ripped down by My<br>
  people. I also accept you unenemying them and claiming you 'love' them. Could it<br>
  be that Twilight is trying to usurp Selene?"</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "It was given with<br>
  love, oh Brother Mine."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Then it's true. Selene had better watch the threat from you."</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "I usurp no one,<br>
  brother mine. Selene has merely taught me her ways... I accept it with ultimate<br>
  humility and love."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Well put more shrine up and I'll make you even more humble."</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "If My children<br>
  wish it, so mote it be. I gave them the gift of free will."</p>

  <p>The rhythms of battle take your breath away as the tumultuous voice of<br>
  Matsuhama, God of Combat echoes overhead, "I've seen better "wars" fought by<br>
  choir girls!"</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Pah! Twilight has yet to accept unconditional organisation war without<br>
  reprimand."</p>

  <p>The rumble of distant oceans can be heard as the voice of Neraeos, God of the<br>
  Sea thunders, "Come now, Lord Matsuhama. They are trying, in their own special<br>
  way."</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "I accept<br>
  unconditional love, brother mine."</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "Do you?"</p>

  <p>The rhythms of battle take your breath away as the tumultuous voice of<br>
  Matsuhama, God of Combat echoes overhead, "How about I make it easy for both of<br>
  you and just have My warriors wipe both of you out? I'm sure there wouldn't be<br>
  many objections."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "You sicken Me Twilight. You really are a shadow of your former self. So be it,<br>
  dwindle and fade."</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "I accept,<br>
  Matsuhama. My love is eternal and un-ending. I have love to give to you as<br>
  well."</p>

  <p>A male voice of Heroic power bellows, "What is war to you is nothing to us. You<br>
  cannot undermine our fundemental teachings, faith and love."</p>

  <p>The rumble of distant oceans can be heard as the voice of Neraeos, God of the<br>
  Sea thunders, "I would compare it to a diseased jellyfish, but only a very<br>
  friendly one, Lord Matsuhama."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "How amusing, you won't even take on Twilight's love Matsuhama?"</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "Thank you. That is<br>
  all I can say... the depth of my gratitude, humility and love has no bounds."</p>

  <p>A formidable male voice bellows, "I accept a chellenge from any of your warriors<br>
  Lord Matsuhama, or any of Lord Twilights warriors, on behalf of Lord Sartan, let<br>
  them come, and will tear them to shreds."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Want to hold Him while I kick Him?"</p>

  <p>The rhythms of battle take your breath away as the tumultuous voice of<br>
  Matsuhama, God of Combat echoes overhead, "I notice you didn't chime into accept<br>
  my challenge, Sartan. Be the good little choir girl you are and go back to your<br>
  room."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "If you want a war Matsuhama, then by all means but wait until I make the dark<br>
  extinct."</p>

  <p>You shout, "Lord Twilight, I am not the type to accept unconditional love. What<br>
  value does Your love have if one has done nothing to earn it? I hope to be loved<br>
  for my virtues and admirable qualities, not out of pitty, or because it was my<br>
  right by birth."</p>

  <p>(Order): Neraeos says, "Generally not a good time to shout, lad."</p>

  <p>(Order): Neraeos says, "Though Twilight is in a loving mood, apparently, so<br>
  likely nothing will happen to you *wink*."</p>

  <p>The rhythms of battle take your breath away as the tumultuous voice of<br>
  Matsuhama, God of Combat echoes overhead, "What kind of tactical sense does that<br>
  make, Sartan? Wait, I forgot that using your name and sense in the same sentence<br>
  is an oxymoron."</p>

  <p>A female voice of awe-inspiring power bellows, "Lord Twilight: To Love something<br>
  is not the same as giving in entirely. Love is not a passive force. There is<br>
  beauty in standing up for your beliefs. I do believe that You might have caught<br>
  the wrong message from my Mother. -Theosis Aramar, Heart of the Beloved."</p>

  <p>(Order): You say, "Yes M'Lord."</p>

  <p>The rhythms of battle take your breath away as the tumultuous voice of<br>
  Matsuhama, God of Combat echoes overhead, "I'll wait. I'd hate for you to get<br>
  crushed and blame it on being loved to death by Twilight."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Then bring it Matsuhama, bring it."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "You think you can do what the Divine alliance could not? This will wait for<br>
  another day because Twilight is not slithering His way out of this one."</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "I am the "Light"<br>
  of "Righteousness" in the face of your "Evil"."</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "Remember... I<br>
  speak in metaphors..."</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "Those who have<br>
  ears to hear, LISTEN... those who have eyes to see, LOOK."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Ahh, I wonder what happened to Pentharian."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "You got him did you Twilight?"</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "Yes, I did,<br>
  Sartan, My love."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Now what you just said was blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "I feel compassion<br>
  for you, dear."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "What can I say? You've gone soft and weak."</p>

  <p>The rhythms of battle take your breath away as the tumultuous voice of<br>
  Matsuhama, God of Combat echoes overhead, "So the two of you against my<br>
  warriors? This should take all of a mortal month or so to end."</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "I have the<br>
  strength of "the Logos" on My side."</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "The will behind<br>
  Creation gives Me strength just as it gives you strength."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Well something went wrong because the love of the Logos went into making<br>
  Selene. Deceptive as ever."</p>

  <p>The rhythms of battle take your breath away as the tumultuous voice of<br>
  Matsuhama, God of Combat echoes overhead, "One other thing Sartan, I hear you<br>
  are fond destroying shrines, so I'll be making a point to see all of the thrines<br>
  IN Mhaldor come down."</p>

  <p>A formidable male voice bellows, "Do none of you accept my challenge? I thought<br>
  you had alittle more faith in your patrons then that, come, any of you, the<br>
  challenge is open to the Patrons themselves if they want to give it a shot.<br>
  -Cain."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "By all means, take them down if you can Matsuhama."</p>

  <p>The sound of a bored yawn echoes across the realm.</p>

  <p>A stream of crackling blue fire sizzles across the sky.<br>
  Darknight has been slain by the might of Sartan, the Malevolent.</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Silverstorm, demonstrate your new found affection by raising more shrines for<br>
  My people to knock down."</p>

  <p>The rumble of distant oceans can be heard as the voice of Neraeos, God of the<br>
  Sea thunders, "This is terribly amusing."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "It's not every day that you see a God go to ruin."</p>

  <p>The rhythms of battle take your breath away as the tumultuous voice of<br>
  Matsuhama, God of Combat echoes overhead, "Well, that's debatable."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "My Order is accepting gold donations for the ultimate demise of Twilight. If<br>
  you wish to sponsor a shrine defilement, see one of My people."</p>

  <p>The rhythms of battle take your breath away as the tumultuous voice of<br>
  Matsuhama, God of Combat echoes overhead, "Sure that isn't to replenish your<br>
  coffers after Twilight, the Lovebunny had you robbed?"</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Partially yes but partially to annoy Twilight I admit."</p>

  <p>The rumble of distant oceans can be heard as the voice of Neraeos, God of the<br>
  Sea thunders, "Lovebunny. I love that term."</p>

  <p>The rhythms of battle take your breath away as the tumultuous voice of<br>
  Matsuhama, God of Combat echoes overhead, "You like anything that involves love<br>
  and women."</p>

  <p>The rumble of distant oceans can be heard as the voice of Neraeos, God of the<br>
  Sea thunders, "Hush, Uncle."</p>

  <p>A crystal clarion female voice resounds, "Who doesn't? - Mashiara."</p>

  <p>(Order): Neraeos says, "Twilight will now be known as the Lovebunny."</p>

  <p>A formidable female voice bellows, "As You have requested, Lord Sartan, so we<br>
  have done at the behest of our Lord and God. Shrines rise again for the pleasure<br>
  of Your people. Our humble gift to You and yours."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Excellent, now stay and defnd them."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Defend even."</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Twilight emanates from the shadows, "Why defend that<br>
  which We give freely, love?"</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Err right."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "How can they be freely given if you are gathering writs?"</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Deceptive as ever."</p>

  <p>You see Lord Twilight's visage appear in the firmament smiling benevolently.</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Ah, so it's benevolence now?"</p>

  <p>#SUB Twilight Lovebunny</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Lovebunny the Benevolent.....how amusing, you'll be claiming the church next."</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Lovebunny emanates from the shadows, "I claim nothing. I<br>
  simply "am"."</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Lovebunny emanates from the shadows, "Now've you got it,<br>
  brother mine!"</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Lovebunny emanates from the shadows, "The dance<br>
  continues..."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "I repeat, you sicken Me."</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Lovebunny emanates from the shadows, "I repeat, I love<br>
  you."</p>

  <p>You hear Lord Lovebunny's giddy laughter echo across Creation.</p>

  <p>The rumble of distant oceans can be heard as the voice of Neraeos, God of the<br>
  Sea thunders, "This is such splendid evening entertainment. A glass of nectar, a<br>
  feast of ambrosia, and two Gods at the verge of gladiatorial combat."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Ah insanity, that explains it."</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Lovebunny emanates from the shadows, "Oh, My children<br>
  has seen fit to do away with the writs that they have. Consider another "gift of<br>
  love"."</p>

  <p>A formidable male voice bellows, "Anyone else!? Mortals who beleive they are<br>
  invicible will soon learn a lesson from me."</p>

  <p>(Order): Neraeos says, "Are any of you bored?"</p>

  <p>(Order): Neraeos says, "I could throw the Nerai into battle with both of them.<br>
  That could be amusing..."</p>

  <p>An authoritative male voice resounds, "Lord Lovebunny, Do you love me too?"</p>

  <p>The silken voice of Lord Lovebunny emanates from the shadows, "Farewell, for now,<br>
  Brother mine. I want to go relax in the "Beginning"."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Save your farewells Lovebunny, you don't have many left."</p>

  <p>The rumble of distant oceans can be heard as the voice of Neraeos, God of the<br>
  Sea thunders, "Come to the feast, Gentlegods! My people have provided a splendid<br>
  repast of fish. The wine is delicious, and there are some celani dancers that<br>
  you simply -must- watch. Nectar for you both!"</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "If I appear in any room containing that wretch, I will cut His head from His<br>
  shoulders and offer it up to the Logos as recompense."</p>

  <p>You tell Tempest of the North, Caz Silverfang, the Raging Bear, "#SUB Lovebunny<br>
  Lovebunny "</p>

  <p>Caz tells you, "*rofl*."</p>

  <p>Caz tells you, "Omg... that looks so much better!"</p>

  <p>The rumble of distant oceans can be heard as the voice of Neraeos, God of the<br>
  Sea thunders, "Fair enough. Immortality will make that truly interesting to<br>
  watch, over and over again..."</p>

  <p>Daemonic laughter resonates across Sapience.</p>

  <p>(Order): Asara says, "Well that was an embarassing display by Lovebunny, don't<br>
  you think?"</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "I have a question for you Sage."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "What has happened to Lovebunny?"</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "What is the nature of His newfound 'love'?"</p>

  <p>The rumble of distant oceans can be heard as the voice of Neraeos, God of the<br>
  Sea thunders, "Consulting mortal oracles now, Lord Sartan?"</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Why not? Don't you heed mortals?"</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Wear My favour Ingo."</p>

  <p>The rumble of distant oceans can be heard as the voice of Neraeos, God of the<br>
  Sea thunders, "Most interesting."</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Ingo is undoubtedly an incarnation of mythos."</p>

  <p>The rumble of distant oceans can be heard as the voice of Neraeos, God of the<br>
  Sea thunders, "Obviously."</p>

  <p>The rumble of distant oceans can be heard as the voice of Neraeos, God of the<br>
  Sea thunders, "Such handsome bunny slippers the Oracle of the Vashnars has, Lord<br>
  Sartan. Would these slippers not indicate a tie to Lord Lovebunny?"</p>

  <p>Pain threatens to rip you asunder as the voice of Sartan tears across the land,<br>
  "Insanity often aids in such visions."</p>
