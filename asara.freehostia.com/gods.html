is a radiant Immortal and is quite easy to see from nearly any position on a 
battlefield. He is a titanic 10 feet tall and wears a magnificent silver plated 
armour engraved with intricate, even miniscule patterns of red enamel that catch 
the sun. The patterns are nearly hypnotic in nature, for as one looks on, each 
swirling pattern consists of smaller details defining more details the closer 
you look, until the smallest details disappear in a haze of obscurity. Aegis 
wields the ancient flaming warsword "Warp Witch of Aegis," which is also shown 
on His holy symbol. He bears no facial hair, and is a beautiful god to behold, 
His face radiating confidence and steadfast determination. Adding to the 
fierceness of his air is a glimpse of the edges of a rather large ornamental 
tattoo on his neck and collar area, which obviously continue under His garments 
and armour to cover a large portion of His torso. His build is much that of a 
barrel chested mountain troll with broad shoulders and a wide neck. He is 
wearing the Diadem of Deimus,a flowing fir lined cape of deepest crimson, a Sash 
of Wisdom, the Boots of Phobus, the Warriors Wings of Aegis, a pair of large 
spiked metal gauntlets covered in red enamel, and a holy symbol medalion 
fastened squarely to His breastplate.</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; BACKGROUND: black; COLOR: white; mso-highlight: black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a radiant Immortal and is towering above all those around Him, standing at 
nearly nine feet tall and clad entirely in a suit of black plate armour. Light 
does not reflect from the surface of the strange metal encasing His frame, the 
metal remaining cold and dark with the passage of time. Connected together at 
all points around His frame, the interlocking plates keep every portion of His 
body hidden from normal view and offer more of a mystery than an answer. A small 
opening has been created in the middle of His helmet, with only a pair of red 
globes staring out from within the darkness hidden behind the visor. With each 
passing moment a puff of steam blasts out from the bottom of the helm, which 
seems to be the only symbol that the Lord of War is indeed awake. He is wearing 
the Diadem of Victory, a silken black cloak, a Sash of Generals, the boots of 
Bevran, the wings of War, a jagged wristblade, <st1:time w:st="on" hour="0" minute="0">midnight</st1:time> black plate armour, the Gauntlets of Strife, 2

almost to His waist in snake-like strands of white. The god's eyes dominate the 
cruel features of His visage, two gaping holes of perfect, light-consuming 
blackness that seem to radiate a fierce, insane malevolence, and His fingers 
extend into long, wickedly sharp talons. His jaw hangs constantly open with 
ravenous intent, revealing shark-like rows of pointed, half-decayed fangs and a 
narrow, writhing black tongue.</span></p>

She whose mercy is ever present yet not always perceived. She who breaks down to 
build up. She has been called the Mother of Sorrows and the Greiving One, for 
Her heart breaks with the sorrows of the world. Her skin is black, like 
glistening jet. What can be seen of Her hair beneath the veil is of shimmering 
silver. She is wearing the Crown of Stars, a dangling black pearl earring, a

ruddiness tinges His cheeks, and the faintest hint of a smile lifts His 
pronounced jaw. It is in His eyes that the fullness of His power is proclaimed. 
Alight with divine fire, a ring of flint encircles His pupils, taking in the

is a radiant Immortal and is wreathed in the Eternal wind, flowing around Him as 
He stays aloft, uplifted by great wings the shade and colour of storm clouds, a 
physical link to His mortal kin. His eyes glow brightly with the fury of 
Thunder, their colour constantly and smoothly changing between deep violet and 
bright cerulean hues. Dancing upon His skin, tiniest motes of light move about 
in rhythmic patterns, occasionally coalescing into a coruscating flare.He is 
wearing a slim neckchain of finest silver, the Circlet of the Winds, a silver 
ring of sapphire and moonstone, a glove made from cerulean scales, a stuffed 
Triton's head, a winged headband of silver, and flowing robes of cascading light 
motes bearing the arms of Vastar.<br><br></span></p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; BACKGROUND: black; COLOR: white; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; mso-highlight: black"><o:p></o:p></span>
